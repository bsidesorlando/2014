				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Bio</h3>
<p>As a serial Entrepreneur, Eric B. Delisle, CEO at DigiThinkIT, Inc., loves projects and learning.</p>
<p>Over the last 25 years Mr. Delisle has developed a broad range of experience from putting the first Virtual Reality Systems in Disney World, personally raising millions for his &#8220;dot com&#8221; during the &#8220;dot com&#8221; boom, doing market research and channel distribution working at MTV Viacom/Networks, being a consultant to the National Science Foundation (NSF) on SBIR funding proposals, designing products and traveling to and manufacturing those products in China, in addition to numerous other ventures.</p>
<p>Whether he is architecting a business model, raising millions from investors, creating a brand, negotiating contracts, building a team, or creating a marketing campaign and developing a sales pitch for an unknown product, Mr. Delisle, has successfully blazed most trails an Entrepreneur needs to learn. In addition to his successes, Mr. Delisle, is usually quick to point out to budding Entrepreneurs that he has failed more times than most people will ever try in business. The secret, he says, is to learn, pivot, and never give up. Today, his way of “giving back” is mentoring other Entrepreneurs to help them achieve their own dreams.</p>
<p>Currently, Mr. Delisle, invests in real estate and startups, and spends most of his time running DigiThinkIT, Inc., a custom software, web development, and consulting company in Downtown Orlando, FL.</p>
<p>Specialties: Web Based Technology and Business Software Systems, Branding and Identity, Fundraising, Marketing, Business Process Automation, Sales Training, SEO &amp; SEM through Relevant Content Marketing, Investing, and almost anything that takes an idea from a napkin to the marketplace.</p>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Funny title? Sometimes the Entrepreneurial path is funny, too.</p>
<p>I would do a talk about how we launched a new Security Product, (a privacy and anonymity tool for consumers), from A &#8211; Z. Unfortunately, that isn&#8217;t always how life happens.</p>
<p>What I will talk about is how to spot an idea, get some basic validation for it&#8217;s commercial viability, and then walk you through the process of considering how (or if) you can turn your idea into a product or company.</p>
<p>Next, we will cover some specific actions you can take to move your idea forward towards commercial success, billions of dollars in your fat pockets, and sexy ladies (or dudes) hanging out the windows of your pimp ride!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Bio</h3>
<p>Alex Hutton is a big fan of trying to understand security and risk through metrics and models.  Currently, Alex is the Director of Risk Management for a top 25 bank.  A former principal for Research &amp; Intelligence with the Verizon Business RISK Team, Alex also helped produce the Verizon Data Breach Investigation, the Verizon&#8217;s PCI Compliance report, was responsible for the VERIS data collection and analysis efforts, and developed information risk models for their Cybertrust services.  Alex is the veteran of several security start-ups.</p>
<p>Alex likes risk and security so much, he spends his spare time working on projects and writing about the subject.  Some of that work includes contributions to the Cloud Security Alliance documents, the ISM3 security management standard, and work with the Open Group Security Forum.   Alex is a founding member of the Society of Information Risk Analysts (<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://societyinforisk.org/" target="_blank">http://societyinforisk.org/</a></span>), and blogs for their website and records a podcast for the membership. He also blogs at the New School of Information Security Blog (<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.newschoolsecurity.com/" target="_blank">http://www.newschoolsecurity.<wbr />com</a></span>).  Some of his earlier thoughts on risk can be found at the Riskanalys.is blog (<a href="http://www.riskanalys.is/" target="_blank">http://www.riskanalys.is</a>).</p>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>How the Concept of Being a Craftsman can Help you Find Meaning and Avoid Burnout.</p>
<p>One of the endemic issues in our industry is burnout. This talk is a tale of how I came to grips with who I am as a security pro, what my work was about, and who my work was really for.</p>

<p>Marcel van den Berg is Team Lead for the Threat Intelligence Group at Team Cymru. Before joining Team Cymru in 2008, Mr. van den Berg was a law enforcement officer for 13 years and helped setup the National High Tech Crime team at the Dutch National Police.</p>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Internet Threat Intelligence can be a challenge to understand. It is more than looking at where security incidents are happening. Answering the questions who?, why? and how? are as important to fully understand the threats faced.</p>
<p>This talk provides a case study on how we analyzed a network of more than 300.000 compromised SOHO routers and answered the who and why question. We also provide insight on how we linked DDoS attacks on a government to malware and botnets of Eastern European criminals.</p>

<p>Jeff (g3k) is the type of person who says he will do something awesome for himself and then never do it. </p>
<p>Anyways, Jeff likes physical security, locks, RFID, CTF, tactical things, EveryDayCarry and bourbon. He&#8217;s been working in the security industry for 4 years and has been in IT for almost 10. He helped put together this little shindig, organized DC407 and is now a part of DC813 and Tampa Hackerspace where he often is found teaching lockpicking or working with the Red Team meetup on projects or training. He hopes to one day be on a red team and to become a real boy.</p>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Red Teaming and penetration testing is becoming more like paramilitary operations as folks who have served abroad start coming home and find that their talents for mayhem abroad makes for a great paycheck back home.</p>
<p>While reading about red team operations online, one might stumble upon blogs or war stories by these men and women and this can be intimidating. I&#8217;ll go over what you need to do to hone your focus to start preparing, and steps you can take to temper your skills. We will go over ways you can legally practice red team skills, some gear that won&#8217;t break the bank and some physical fitness tips.</p>
<p>I am not on a red team, but I would like to be one day. How about you?</p>
